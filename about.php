        My name is Jonathan Richter and I am an aspiring Web Developer. Going through my
        High School days I never really knew what I wanted to do once I got out,
        But I was always a fan of gaming and one day someone from Sullivan
        College of Technology and Design came to my senoir class. They talked
        about all of the majors and classes that I would take while attending
        there and told everyone that if they were interested that we should call
        and schedule a visit. I called and told them gaming interested me and
        they said they didn't have a gaming specific major but they had Dynamic
        Web Development which had the coding. I decided to hear them out and
        went on the visit, and i liked what I saw so I attended. The things, 
        I learned about Web Design blew me away and I actually really enjoyed 
        the work so thats why im here today. I never intended to be here, but I
        fell into it and I plan on sticking with it. Plus I never really gave up
        on game design, the multimedia classes and the coding have allowed me to
        create the things I always wanted to make, fro example the checkers game
        thats on this very page so check it out.
