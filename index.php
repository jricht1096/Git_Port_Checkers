        This Site was created in order to host my final project for my PHP 1
        Dynamic Web language 2. The project was created in Netbeans.
        My idea for the project was to
        create a checkers game using php code. I also wanted to incorporate the
        use of a database along with SQL code in order to allow the game the
        ability to be 2 player and run across 2 different computers. In order to
        access the game choose the checkers tab up at the top. If your desire
        is to learn more about me(Jonathan Richter) I created an about tab which
        gives you a short summary on how my academic career led me here. Thank
        you for visiting and have a good day.
